# 04 Coding Quiz #
## User Story ##
* This project enabled me to better understand the DOM
* I learned how information can be stored about a webpage using local storage
* On click events make a lot more sense to me now
* I had never thought of attaching functions to "events" prior to this assignment
## Features ##
* Click Begin Quiz! to get started!
* Answer all questions to log a high score
* buttons to navigate to high score page and buttons to navigate back to start page
* My high scores page is on the same HTML page as my quiz, which is different than majority of the class. I chose to do this for an extra challenge.
* The end screen where you can submit your score, appears different than the high score screen. Did this using display none and navigating the DOM
